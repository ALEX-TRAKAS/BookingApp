# bookingapp
The project I developed was a cross-platform restaurant reservation application. Users could select the date, time, and number of people for their reservation. Additionally, they had the ability to filter available restaurants, add restaurants to their favorites, and check their reservations. The application provided a secure and smooth user experience on both Android and web platforms.

## Technologies Used:
* **Flutter Framework:** For building the user interface and application logic.
* **Firebase Authentication:** For user authentication and management.
* **Firebase Firestore:** For storing and managing data.
* **Node.js:** Used only for the web version of the application to solve CORS issues, allowing secure API calls.
* **Google Places API:** For searching and selecting locations.
